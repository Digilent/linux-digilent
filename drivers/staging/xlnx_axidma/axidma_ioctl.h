/**

 * Sometimes, it may be useful to use a DMA buffer that was allocated by another

 *
 * However, the driver cannot simply access this DMA buffer as is. The user must
 * register the buffer with the driver, so that it can get the information from
 * the driver that originally allocated it.
 *
 * This uses the kernel's DMA buffer sharing API. Thus, the user must first tell
 * the other driver to export the DMA buffer for sharing, typically done through
 * an IOCTL. This will return a file descriptor, which the user must pass into
 * this function, along with the virtual address in userspace.

 *  - fd - File descriptor corresponding to the DMA buffer share.
